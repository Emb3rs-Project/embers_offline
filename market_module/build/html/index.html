<h1>Welcome to EMB3Rs’s Market Module documentation!<a class="headerlink" href="#welcome-to-emb3rs-s-market-module-documentation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The EMB3Rs platform has been designed to evaluate the reuse and trade of waste Heating
and Cooling (HC) in a holistic perspective within an industrial process,
energy system environment, or in District Heating and Cooling (DHC) systems
under-regulated and liberalized market environment. The platform empowers
industrial users and stakeholders to investigate the economic potential
of their investment in the recovery of waste HC as an energy resource, based on
the simulation of supply-demand scenarios. To this end, the platform is able to
simulate multiple business and market models for DHC systems.
The EMB3Rs platform is composed of five modules: Core Functionalities (CF),
Geographical Information System (GIS), Techno-Economic Optimisation (TEO),
Market Module (MM), and Business Module (BM).
The dedicated MM allows users to simulate current and future trends for the HC markets,
allowing them to choose the best market framework aligned with the users’ economic,
environmental and social interests. This is especially important for users who have
invested (or are considering investing) in waste heat recovery to assess the economic
potential and environmental savings of their investment. Recently, peer-to-peer (P2P)
and community-based markets have been presented as an alternative to existing pool
energy markets, both for HC and electricity systems. Therefore, the MM models and
implements the P2P and community-based market designs, in addition to the conventional
pool market design. In this way, users can create, test and validate different market
structures for selling and buying energy in DHC systems. The outputs of the market
analysis enable users (e.g., industries, supermarkets and data centres) to estimate
potential costs and revenues for different market participants from trading excess
heat and cold, under different market designs.
Based on a user’s experience and motivation, different types of market analysis might
be required. To address this, the MM was divided into short-term and long-term analyses.
The short-term market analysis is intended to give an overview of individual agents’
performance when subjected to different market features. In this design, users are
able to change some parameters and easily and quickly check the effect of such changes
on market outcomes. In this way, the effect of different market settings can be studied
in case studies with short horizons. On the other hand, the long-term market analysis
can be used to investigate market outcomes for agents in wider time ranges like months
or years. This is more suitable when the user wants to evaluate the profitability of
potential investments.</p>

<section id="inputs">
<h2>Inputs<a class="headerlink" href="#inputs" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to run a simulation, some inputs must be chosen by the user. Some of these are specific to the desired market design, namely Pool, P2P or
Community-based market.
First of all, the user has to select the market design (e.g., Pool, P2P, or Community). Regardless of the selected market, the user must select the number
of simulated hours, which can go up to 48h. In addition,
a date to start the simulation is selected. This is used to select the correct inputs from other modules (TEO, CF), that will be used to create the agent bids.
Next, the offer type is selected, which includes the simple, block or energy budget options.
There is an option to include electricity market dependence. This option makes the price and quantity bids of agents that are CHPs dependent on an input
electricity price (forecast).
The product differentiation option is only needed for the P2P market design. Here, the available options are CO2 emissions, energy losses, distance or
no preference.</p>
<p>In case the Community market is selected, the user must provide several settings. The type of objective function must be chosen (either “autonomy” or
“peakShaving”), which will specify what goal the community is trying to achieve. In addition, the user must input three parameters
representing the penalty for importing heat, the reward for exporting heat, and the penalty for the size of the peak import. Default values are presented
for these parameters, but, optionally, the user can modify them.</p>
<p>In case the user simulates a Pool market, there is an option to include network operating conditions in the market. If this option is selected,
the dispatch determined by the market will respect the thermal energy flow directions in the network. Note that this does not mean the sizes of thermal
energy flows will be feasible, as this needs to be checked by a network operator. If necessary, the network operator would have to re-dispatch.</p>

<p>After the Inputs are defined, other parameters must be provided. These parameters are not only linked to the individual agents and their characteristics,
but also the network features. Some can be defined by the user, others come from other EMB3Rs modules, namely CF, TEO and GIS.
The information related to the bids, namely
prices and quantities must be mandatorily provided for each agent and each time step.</p>
<p>The model uses sets related to the time slices for the simulation and the agents’ names. These sets are automatically created within the module,
based on the agents’ bids and the user-selected market horizon.</p>
<p>Under some settings, GIS data is necessary to run the market. This is the case when the user chooses to include “network = directions”, or whether a
P2P market considering technical losses or network distances preferences is selected. The GIS module provides information on the linked nodes and correspondent distances.
If the user has chosen to include block offers, a dictionary with the block offer information must be provided by the user.</p>

<h2>Optimization Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>To compute the MM through the long-term market analysis, some variables are used to represent the agents’ behaviour within each market section.
Ln, Gn and Pn are related to individual agents and are computed both for centralized and decentralized modes. Snm, Bnm and Tnm are related to the
trades between peers but are only computed in the decentralized model. Also, a dual variable is obtained, representing the market clearing price
for each transaction.</p>
